#+DESCRIPTION: HOW TO SET UP SDDM

* MY DISTRO 
I am using arch linux so all the documents will work on arch you may find all the command on the Internet for your distro.

* INSTALLATION PROCESS
First you have to install the sddm display manager with this command 
#+begin_src shell
sudo pacman -S sddm
#+end_src

Then you have to set up sddm as your window manager:- 
#+begin_src shell
sudo systemctl enable sddm
#+end_src
Then you need to reboot your system
#+begin_src shell
reboot
#+end_src

* SDDM CONFIGURETION
After installing and enabling sddm you have to customize your sddm manager.
First you have to copy the nothing_sddm_theme to /usr/share/sddm/themes/ folder.
#+begin_src shell
sudo cp -r dotfiels/sddm/nothing_sddm_theme/ /usr/share/sddm/themes/ 
#+end_src

Then you have to change the theme by eiditing the /etc/sddm.conf.d/theme.conf.user file:-
#+begin_src shell
vim /etc/sddm.conf.d/theme.conf.user #replace vim with your text editor
#+end_src
The should look like this:-
#+begin_src shell
[Theme]
current = sequoia_2
#+end_src

You need to change the Current theme to:-
#+begin_src shell
[Theme]
current = nothing_sddm_theme
#+end_src

Now give a reboot or logout form your system and the themes should work perfectly:-
#+begin_src shell
reboot
#+end_src

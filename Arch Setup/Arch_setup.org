* INSTALLING ARCH LINUX
So This is how I setup my system. I use arch linux so at first you have to visit [[https://archlinux.org/download/][ARCH LINUX]] website and
download the arch iso. Then you to burn it in a pendrive you can find the tutorial [[https://youtu.be/gAnA7X8fAGs?si=PgrMLHdeqaWcD_EH][here]]. And then follow
the  [[https://youtu.be/AYxaNjbC1wg?si=UYbJj1Zr-gjapE1a][arch install tutorial]]. I install arch like this. Just change the desktop envornment to i3 and you are
good to go. 

* SOFTWARE SETUP
I am mainly trying to use only one software [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][EMACS]]. I first saw this software in [[https://www.youtube.com/@hexdump1337][hexdump]]. He is an amazing
person. I follow him since early 2024. I like his work so much. After I saw the workflow and the
customization of [[https://blog.leonardotamiano.xyz/][Leonardo Tamiano ]]I want his desktop envornment and I want to use my system like him.
Then I fist learn about window manager. My first window manager was [[https://i3wm.org/][i3wm]]. I used it like 6 month.
After learning the bacis of window manager then I started learning emacs. I learned the bacis from two 
youtuber's. They are:
